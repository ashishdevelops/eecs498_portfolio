Custom Object and Interaction - Trashketball

Our custom object is an object inspired by a game played in our middle 

school classroom called trashketball. It is a game where students would 

shoot pieces of garbage into a recycling bin for points, typically done as 

part of an in-class competition to make exam reviews more exciting (for 

whatever reason). Our object is a combination of a printer and a trash can 

with a backboard, all of which serve a purpose in our minigame.

The minigame is passive and is always available to play. The player's goal 

is to throw the trash into the bin. When you throw a trash object into the 

bin, the lights on the backboard glow green. After making a basket, the 

printer creates a piece of trash and throws it at the player who can try 

to catch it in air or will have to pick it up afterwards (to be thrown 

again if the player chooses). The complete "scoring then printing" action 

is repeatable so the game can be played indefinitely.

Throughout the course of the game, the game's object keeps track of the 

number of baskets made by the player and will display this after each 

basket. The game also displays the distance of the throw, which is used as 

the player's current score. The farthest distance the player has managed 

to make a goal is tracked as the player's high score. This allows the 

player to keep improving their trashketball skills.
